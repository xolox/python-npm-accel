The npm-accel program is a wrapper for npm_ (the Node.js_ package manager) that
was created to optimize **one specific use case**: Creating a node_modules_
directory from a package.json_ file as quickly as possible.

It works on the assumption that you build node_modules directories more
frequently then you change the contents of package.json files, because it
computes a fingerprint of the dependencies and uses that fingerprint as a cache
key, to cache the complete node_modules directory in a tar archive.

The program is intended to be used in environments that always or frequently
start with an empty node_modules directory and need to populate the complete
directory from scratch (e.g. continuous integration builds and deployments).
I'm specifically not claiming that you will see any speed improvements if
you're updating existing node_modules directories.

The npm-accel program is currently tested on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and PyPy
(yes, it's written in Python, deal with it :-P). It's intended to work on UNIX
systems like Linux and Mac OS X and specifically won't work on Windows (see
`supported operating systems`_ for details).

Status
------

The npm-accel project was developed and published in September '16 because I
got fed up waiting for ``npm install`` to finish, specifically in the context
of continuous integration builds and deployments (where you frequently start
with an empty ``node_modules`` directory). It was developed in about a week
without much prior knowledge about Node.js_ or npm_, which explains why it's
written in Python :-P. On the one hand npm-accel hasn't seen much actual use,
on the other hand it has a test suite with about 95% test coverage and I was
careful not to repeat the bugs I encountered in npm-cache_ and
npm-fast-install_ while evaluating those tools :-).

To summarize: Give it a try, see if it actually speeds up your ``npm install``
use case and then decide whether you want to use it or not. The first releases
of npm-accel are labeled as `alpha releases`_ because the program hasn't seen
much real world use (and I'm no expert in Node.js and npm).

Performance
-----------

The following table lists the output of ``npm-accel --benchmark`` (with some
enhancements) against a private code base with about 30 dependencies listed in
the package.json file (resulting in a 401 MB node_modules directory):

=====================  =========  =======================  ==========
Approach               Iteration  Elapsed time             Percentage
=====================  =========  =======================  ==========
npm install                  1/2  1 minute and 36 seconds      100.0%
npm install                  2/2  1 minute and 40 seconds      104.1%
npm-accel                    1/2  1 minute and 40 seconds      104.1%
npm-accel                    2/2             7.26 seconds        7.5%
npm-cache install npm        1/2  3 minutes and 9 seconds      196.8%
npm-cache install npm        2/2  2 minutes and 9 seconds      134.3%
npm-fast-install             1/2  1 minute and 5 seconds        72.2%
npm-fast-install             2/2  1 minute and 6 seconds        73.3%
=====================  =========  =======================  ==========

Some notes about this benchmark:

- Each of the four installation methods is run twice. The first run starts with
  empty cache directories and is intended to "prime the cache". The second run
  is intended to actually use the cache and should be able to do so quite
  effectively, given that the package.json file does not change between the two
  runs.

- During the benchmark, the caching performed by npm-accel is only used in the
  fourth row of the table above. This is because the original point of the
  benchmark (for me) was to find out whether it was even worth it to develop
  and publish npm-accel. That is to say, if it wouldn't have given a speed
  improvement it wasn't worth my time, nor yours :-P.

Installation
------------

The `npm-accel` package is available on PyPI_ which means installation
should be as simple as:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install npm-accel

There's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per
user site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing
system wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so
if this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these
instructions ;-).

Alternatively if you are running Arch Linux, npm-accel is `available in AUR`_.

Usage
-----

There are two ways to use the `npm-accel` package: As the command line program
``npm-accel`` and as a Python API. For details about the Python API please
refer to the API documentation available on `Read the Docs`_. The command line
interface is described below.

.. A DRY solution to avoid duplication of the `npm-accel --help' text:
..
.. [[[cog
.. from humanfriendly.usage import inject_usage
.. inject_usage('npm_accel.cli')
.. ]]]

**Usage:** `npm-accel [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]`

The npm-accel program is a wrapper for npm (the Node.js package manager) that
optimizes one specific use case: Building a "node_modules" directory from a
"package.json" file as quickly as possible.

It works on the assumption that you build "node_modules" directories more
frequently then you change the contents of "package.json" files, because it
computes a fingerprint of the dependencies and uses that fingerprint as a
cache key, to cache the complete "node_modules" directory in a tar archive.

**Supported options:**

.. csv-table::
   :header: Option, Description
   :widths: 30, 70


   "``-p``, ``--production``","Don't install modules listed in ""devDependencies""."
   "``-i``, ``--installer=NAME``","Set the installer to use. Supported values for ``NAME`` are ""npm"", ""yarn"",
   ""npm-cache"" and ""npm-fast-install"". When yarn is available it will be
   selected as the default installer, otherwise the default is npm."
   "``-c``, ``--cache-directory=DIR``",Set the pathname of the directory where the npm-accel cache is stored.
   "``-l``, ``--cache-limit=COUNT``","Set the maximum number of tar archives to preserve. When the cache
   directory contains more than ``COUNT`` archives the least recently used
   archives are removed. Defaults to 20."
   "``-n``, ``--no-cache``","Disallow writing to the cache managed by npm-accel (reading is still
   allowed though). This option does not disable internal caching
   performed by npm, yarn, npm-cache and npm-fast-install."
   "``-b``, ``--benchmark``","Benchmark and compare the following installation methods:
   
   1. npm install
   2. yarn
   3. npm-accel
   4. npm-cache
   5. npm-fast-install
   
   The first method performs no caching (except for the HTTP caching that's
   native to npm) while the other four methods each manage their own cache
   (that is to say, the caching logic of npm-accel will only be used in the
   second method).
   
   Warning: Benchmarking wipes the caches managed by npm, yarn, npm-accel,
   npm-cache and npm-fast-install in order to provide a fair comparison
   (you can override this in the Python API but not on the command line)."
   "``-r``, ``--remote-host=SSH_ALIAS``","Operate on a remote system instead of the local system. The
   ``SSH_ALIAS`` argument gives the SSH alias of the remote host."
   "``-v``, ``--verbose``",Increase logging verbosity (can be repeated).
   "``-q``, ``--quiet``",Decrease logging verbosity (can be repeated).
   "``-h``, ``--help``",Show this message and exit.

.. [[[end]]]

Future improvements
-------------------

**Accelerate installations with changes**
 Currently when the fingerprint (cache key) of the dependencies doesn't match a
 cache entry, the complete caching mechanism is bypassed and a full ``npm
 install`` run is performed. It might be faster to unpack a previous (now
 invalid) cache entry corresponding to the same project and then run ``npm
 install && npm prune``. Given the fact that defining "same project" might be
 non-trivial I'm not actually sure this is worth my time.

**Dealing with optionalDependencies**
 I've never seen ``optionalDependencies`` in the wild but encountered them
 while browsing through the package.json_ documentation. Maybe these should be
 part of the computed cache keys aswell?

.. _supported operating systems:

Supported operating systems
---------------------------

The npm-accel program was developed to work on UNIX systems like Linux and Mac
OS X. It requires several external commands to be installed (e.g. ``mkdir``,
``mv``, ``rm``, ``tar`` and ``which``).

I've tried to keep all of the external command invocations compatible with the
Linux and BSD variants of commands like tar_, that is to say npm-accel uses
only short options and skips the more esoteric features even if they would be
useful. If you find that I failed in this respect, please feel free to report
this as a bug.

For posterity: It was a conscious decision (for several reasons) to use the
tar_ program instead of manipulating tar archives via Python's `tarfile
module`_.
